                <h2>Day 1</h2>
                <p>
                  This was one the first days of an induction-like program where
                  our mentor ingratiated himself with us. Introductions were
                  made by mentor and apprentices alike, aspirations were
                  discussed. Our mentor gave us three questions that we had to
                  answer honestly. After the first round of answers felt too
                  generalized and manufactured, the mentor told us to be honest
                  to ourselves and to say what truly feels right. He told us to
                  tackle the first question again and each of us did. The
                  question was, “List any three things about you.” Ashwin
                  regaled us with a tale from his childhood in which he went
                  against the herd mindset. Akhil talked passionately about his
                  goal of joining the Army, and listed a few of his creative
                  accomplishments i.e., his YouTube channel and also mentioned
                  that he is familiar with being fiscally responsible. Arjun
                  talked from personal experiences about how he is able to view
                  a problem from different sides and also talked about his
                  passion, Robotics. Chetan talked about his expertise at
                  handling different situations and also talked about the
                  sharing of knowledge. On tackling the first question itself,
                  the session time was over and so goodbyes were said and the
                  meeting was adjourned.
                </p>
                <h2>Day 2</h2>
                <p>
                  On the second day of the introduction, it was much more
                  relaxed and much did not transpire. A formal introduction was
                  done once again by the apprentices and a doubt clearance
                  session was triggered by Akhil asking about an
                  industry-related question. Conversation about speed detection
                  camera working on roads was engaged. The mentor had let the
                  apprentices know that the mentorship program would come into
                  full swing from the next session and told the students to
                  prepare a Resume which will be evaluated by the mentor and
                  advice will be given as such, regarding the resumes, general
                  interview questions and how to tackle them.
